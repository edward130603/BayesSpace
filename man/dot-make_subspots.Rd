\title{Define offsets and Manhattan distances for each subspot layout.}
\usage{
.make_subspots(
  platform,
  xdist,
  ydist,
  force = FALSE,
  nsubspots.per.edge = 3,
  tolerance = 1.05
)
}
\arguments{
\item{platform}{The platform from which the data comes.}

\item{scalef}{Scale factors of Visium data.}
}
\value{
Matrix of x and y offsets, one row per subspot
}
\description{
Hex spots are divided into 6 triangular subspots, square spots are divided
into 9 squares. Offsets are relative to the spot center. A unit corresponds
to the diameter of a spot.
}
\details{
Manhattan distance is used here instead of Euclidean to avoid numerical
issues.
