\title{Estimate the distance between two neighboring spots}
\usage{
.compute_interspot_distances(sce)
}
\arguments{
\item{sce}{SingleCellExperiment (must include array_row, array_col, pxl_row_in_fullres, pxl_col_in_fullres
in colData)}
}
\value{
doubles xdist, ydist
}
\description{
Fit linear models between each image pixel coordinate and its corresponding
array coordinate to estimate the pixel distance between two spots along
each axis. Add these distances to estimate the L1 distance between two
spots, then add a small buffer.
