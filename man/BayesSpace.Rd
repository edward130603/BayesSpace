\title{BayesSpace: A package for processing spatial transcriptomes}
\description{
Tools for clustering and enhancing the resolution of spatial gene expression
experiments. BayesSpace clusters a low-dimensional representation of the gene
expression matrix, incorporating a spatial prior to encourage neighboring
spots to cluster together. The method can enhance the resolution of the
low-dimensional representation into "sub-spots", for which features such as
gene expression or cell type composition can be imputed.
