Description: BayesSpace clusters a low-dimensional representation of the gene 
    expression matrix, incorporating a spatial prior to encourage neighboring 
    spots to cluster together. The method can enhance the resolution of the 
    low-dimensional representation into "sub-spots", for which features such as
    gene expression or cell type composition can be imputed.
