Description: Tools for clustering and enhancing the resolution of spatial gene
    expression experiments. BayesSpace clusters a low-dimensional representation
    of the gene expression matrix, incorporating a spatial prior to encourage
    neighboring spots to cluster together. The method can enhance the resolution
    of the low-dimensional representation into "sub-spots", for which features
    such as gene expression or cell type composition can be imputed.
