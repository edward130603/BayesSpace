## Preprocessing

We'll obtain one of the melanoma samples from the 2018 Spatial Transcriptomics
paper for this example.

TODO: switch to a subset of a Visium dataset so we don't need to specify position.cols and radius in demo
```{r download}
sce <- getRDS(dataset="2018_thrane_melanoma", sample="ST_mel1_rep2")
```

Our processed datasets already include PCs, but in general it's necessary to
preprocess samples by running PCA. We recommend running PCA on only the top
highly variable genes.
```{r preprocess}
set.seed(102)
dec <- scran::modelGeneVar(sce)
top <- scran::getTopHVGs(dec, n=2000)
sce <- scater::runPCA(sce, subset_row=top)
```

We can use the `qTune()` and `qPlot()` functions to help choose the number of
clusters to use in our analysis.
```{r tuning_q}
sce <- qTune(sce, position.cols=c("col", "row"), radius=1)
qPlot(sce)
```

## Clustering
The `spatialCluster()` function will cluster the spots, and add the predicted
cluster labels to `colData(sce)`. Typically, and for analyses in the paper, we
suggest running with at least 10,000 iterations (`nrep=10000`), but we use 1,000
iteration in this demonstration for the sake of runtime.

TODO: clarify row/col vs imagerow/imagecol, and ST vs visium
```{r cluster}
set.seed(149)
sce <- spatialCluster(sce, q=4, init.method="mclust", model="t", nrep=10000, 
                      position.cols=c("col", "row"), radius=1, save.chain=TRUE)
```

Both the mclust initialization (`cluster.init`) and the BayesSpace cluster assignments (`spatial.cluster`) are now available in the SingleCellExperiment's `colData`.
```{r cluster.results}
head(colData(sce))
```


We can plot the cluster assignments over the spatial locations of the spots.
```{r cluster.plot, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(sce)), aes(x = col, y = row, fill = factor(spatial.cluster))) +
  geom_point(size = 7, pch = 22) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "Cluster") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "red", "blue", "yellow")) +
  theme_void() + 
  coord_fixed()
```

## Enhanced resolution

The `spatialEnhance()` function will enhance the resolution of the principal
components, and add these PCs as well as predicted cluster labels at subspot
resolution to a new SingleCellExperiment.
```{r enhance, eval=TRUE}
enhanced <- spatialEnhance(sce, q=4, init=sce$spatial.cluster, model="t", nrep=10000, 
                           position.cols=c("col", "row"), xdist=1, ydist=1, save.chain=TRUE)
```

The enhanced SingleCellExperiment includes an index to the parent spot in the original `sce` (`spot.idx`), along with an index to the subspot. It adds the offsets to the original spot coordinates, and provides the enhanced cluster label (`spatial.cluster`).
```{r enhance.results}
head(colData(enhanced))
```


We can plot the enhanced cluster assignments as above.
```{r enhance.plot, eval=TRUE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
ggplot(as.data.frame(colData(enhanced)), aes(x = col, y = row, fill = factor(spatial.cluster))) +
  geom_point(size = 2.5, pch = 22) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "Cluster") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("purple", "red", "blue", "yellow")) +
  theme_void() + 
  coord_fixed()
```

Note that the enhanced PCs are stored as a `reducedDim` and the enhanced
SingleCellExperiment has no assays. To impute expression (or other features) at
subspot resolution, we need to run `enhanceFeatures()` afterwards.

By default, log-normalized expression (`logcounts(sce)`) is imputed, but other
assays or arbitrary features can be specified.
```{r enhanceFeatures, eval=FALSE}
enhanced <- enhanceFeatures(enhanced, sce) 
```

TODO: add outputs/plot for enhanceFeatures

## Accessing Markov chains

If `save.chain` is set to `TRUE` in either `spatialCluster()` or
`spatialEnhance()`, the chain associated with the respective MCMC run is
preserved to disk as an HDF5 file. The path to this file is stored in the
SingleCellExperiment's metadata at `metadata(sce)$h5.chain`, and can be read
directly using `mcmcChain()`.

The chain is provided as a `coda::mcmc` object, which can be analyzed with
[TidyBayes](https://mjskay.github.io/tidybayes/) or as a matrix. The object has
one row per iteration, with the values of the parameters concatenated across the
row. Columns are named with the parameter name and index (if any).
```{r mcmcChain, eval=TRUE}
chain <- mcmcChain(sce)
chain[1:5, 1:5]
```

To remove the HDF5 file from disk and remove its path from the metadata, use
`removeChain()`.
